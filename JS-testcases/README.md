To run our test cases

1) Set up echosTube using the instructions on the github (https://github.com/orizens/echoes)

2) Take the files in the in the folder and replace the files with the same name in the echos directory. 

E.g. There might be a file called in the original project X.spec.js replace it with file X.spec.js from this repository. 

3) Run the test cases with command npm test.
